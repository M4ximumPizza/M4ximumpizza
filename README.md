  <summary>My Tech Journey</summary>
  Five years ago, my journey began with an introduction to Code.org. I delved into the essentials of web developmentâ€”mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript during the summer of 2018. Those initial steps led me to craft starter class websites and gain a fundamental understanding of browser mechanisms.

  During the subsequent winter, my curiosity led me to Linux, where I immersed myself in comprehending the Linux kernel. This exploration taught me the intricacies of Bash and the infrastructure of Linux, sparking my interest in unraveling the inner workings of computers.

  For the next three years, I delved deep into understanding computer architecture and functionality. In December 2021, I ventured into Scratch and began constructing Geometry Dash levels. Simultaneously, I ventured into Python, employing it to program levels and mods for Geometry Dashâ€”a passion that      endures to this day.

  In the summer of 2022, I expanded my programming repertoire by mastering Java and Kotlin. This knowledge propelled me into exploring the mechanics of Minecraft, where I engaged with Mojang's projects, delving into Brigadier and DatafixerUpper.

  Continuing this journey, in spring 2023, I embraced a deeper dive into Computer Science, delving into the intricacies of C++. Presently, I'm engrossed in learning Cyber Security, understanding the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and actively contributing to a Java Library within the FCCL project.

  It's an ongoing adventureâ€”one that constantly evolves as I explore new realms and deepen my understanding of the digital landscape.
