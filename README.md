  <summary>My Tech Journey</summary>

I began my journey five years ago with Code.org, diving into web development basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Crafting class websites gave me a grasp of browser mechanisms.

Curiosity led me to Linux in the subsequent winter, where I delved into the kernel, mastering Bash and Linux's infrastructure. This sparked my interest in computer inner workings.

For three years, I focused on understanding computer architecture. In 2021, I explored Scratch, creating Geometry Dash levels and using Python for game modsâ€”a passion that continues.

Mastering Java and Kotlin in 2022 expanded my programming skills. Exploring Minecraft mechanics, I engaged with Mojang's projects, diving into Brigadier and DatafixerUpper.

Spring 2023 saw me diving deeper into Computer Science, particularly with C++. Now, I'm deeply involved in Cyber Security, learning LLVM compiler infrastructure, and contributing to a Java Library in the FCCL project.

My journey's ongoing, evolving as I explore new realms in the digital landscape.
